This post chronicles the transformative journey that the Judiciary of Entre Ríos, Argentina, where I serve as Director, is undertaking in the realm of statistics.

## 2016 Creation of a Specialized Body

The Area of Planning, Management and Statistics, created in June 2016, undertook the project of reforming the judicial statistics of the province, beset by serious difficulties, through a profound change in working tools and more broadly in organizational culture (i.e. from the digitization of information and the design of new indicators, to the creation of a new calendar of statistical processes and internal regulations). It had the collaboration of magistrates and officials from all over the province who provided the substantive knowledge necessary for the generation of reliable judicial metrics. Despite limitations in tools and staff, efficient solutions were implemented, such as the use of the open-source software R-Statistical Computing for data processing. In a span of 10 months, judicial statistics were revolutionized, optimizing report production times, introducing new indicators, and launching a new Public Judicial Statistics System, which extended to all branches of provincial justice by June 2018 [(more info)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cmH8HYod5JQZrH1Wp-OtW8ARInqADkfbFpJ7hQl5zgE/edit).

## 2019 Public Dashboards

After two challenging years of work, the [Statistics Dashboards](https://tablero.jusentrerios.gov.ar/) of the Judicial Power of Entre Ríos were made available online. On December 17, 2019, the provincial justice system presented to society a public access tool to judicial indicators based on a formal production system, entirely supported by the open-source software R-Statistical Computing.

With this presentation, the team I was fortunate to lead fulfilled a long-sought goal in terms of open judicial data, creating along the way a unique model of judicial statistics in Argentina [(more info)](https://medium.com/@castilloclaudiosebastian/estad%C3%ADstica-p%C3%BAblica-y-administraci%C3%B3n-de-justicia-d33141da0708).

## 2021 Judicial Activity in COVID19 Pandemic

I made a brief internal presentation on the impact of the Covid-19 Pandemic on judicial activity, with some details about the number of processes carried out between 2020 and 2021, which had a significant impact as it dispelled doubts about the activity of justice and the importance of its services [(more info)](https://www.jusentrerios.gov.ar/2021/06/23/en-pandemia-2-millones-de-actos-procesales-y-mas-de-790-mil-presentaciones-digitales/). After that, I gave a presentation on local television about the situation of the Judiciary during the sanitary isolation of the Pandemic:

Finally, by the end of that year, we were already sharing our statistical transformation experience with all Judicial Powers in our country, gathered in the Federal Council of Courts and Superior Courts of Argentina [(more info)](https://rpubs.com/ClaudioSebastianCastillo/824728).
