**Features**

1. Web Scraping Module: To extract and gather news content from targeted portals and source pages. (Features: automated scraping schedules, resilient to website structure changes, captures multimedia content, including images and videos).
2. Enriched Document Database: process and store news content in an enriched format for advanced analytics. (Features: embeddings representation for similarity and clustering analysis, summarization, Named Entity Recognition, relationships between identified entities for contextual understanding).
3. Custom Report Generator: provide users with tailored reports based on their specific criteria. (Features: search by topics, persons, locations, or any custom criteria, automated report generation schedules, visually appealing report templates with charts, graphs, and images).

**Key Benefits**

* :(fab fa-searchengin fa-fw): **Up-to-date Information** ensures users always have the latest news at their fingertips.
* :(fa fa-line-chart): **Insightful Analysis** goes beyond mere news aggregation by providing deep insights and context.
* :(fa fa-user-circle): **Customization** Tailored reports mean users only see what's relevant to them.
